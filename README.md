# Fantasy Quiz

## Overview
The goal of this project was to build a quiz web application using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I chose to use jQuery here because I wanted to practice my skills with that library and I also chose to add Bootstrap to make building the frame of the app a bit easier. 

The quiz is centered around fantasy authors and once the user clicks on the start button, they are asked a series of questions with a timer of 30 seconds. Each question that they answer correctly adds 1 to the score and each incorrect answer subtracts from the timer. When the timer reaches zero or they answer all of the questions, they reach a gameover state that displays the high scores.
